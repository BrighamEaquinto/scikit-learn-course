- read in data
- feature engineering testing. Come back to this step frequently.  
- initiate pipeline:
    - apply feature engineering
    - preprocess 
        - scale 
        - encode categorical data
        - impute
    - initiate multiple models
        - initiate gridsearch dictionary of parameters for _each_ model
        - Juxtapose or not juxtpose?
    - loop through each model and each model's parameter options
    - measure success 
    - grab best model and best hyperparameters
    - pickle the model

- Why a pipeline if the goal is to do this once?
    - be able to go back and tune as needed?
- When grab the most important features?


- read in data
- read in model
- use model to predict `model.predict`
