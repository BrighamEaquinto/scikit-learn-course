# Preface {.unnumbered}

The goal of this book is to make a bootcamp-like course similar to [R Bootcamp](https://brighameaquinto.github.io/). Material will cover introductary to intermediate topics. 

This book will not remake the [Scikit-Learn website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), nor will it be a deepdive like the great textbook [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1098125975). This is intended for students ______. Students are encouraged to continue their journey of machine learning beyond what this book can provide, seek out other resources that will benefit them, and ultimately, master machine learning.

### Topics Covered:

- What is machine learning
    - Structured data machine learning vs unstructured data deep learning (TensorFlow and PyTorch)
    - classification vs regression vs cluster (NNs too or keep for other course?)
    - take a step back and think "What will determine how a student does in class?", that is what machine learning does. 
- How to use a machine learning model
- Models, models everywhere, nor any drop to drink (Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous phrase) or (insert Dr. Seuss reference here) 
    - linear
    - logistic
    - tree
    - random forest
    - KNN
    - stocastic gradient decent
    - gaussian
    - support vector 
    - naive bayes 
    - gradient boosted  
    - xgboost
- Brute force these models or use calculus to determine the best fit for the problem that is at hand?
- the whole process (making a pipeline rather than a useless one off):
    - read in data
    - clean/tidy/wrangle
    - preprocess
    - fit model
    - kfold 
    - test 
    - pick the best one based off a predetermined metric
- deploy the model
    - client-side & server-side
    - API calls are "function-maker-available-ers"
- Statistics vs machine learning 
    - descriptive statistics
    - inferential statistics
    - machine learning
- visualizing the model on a two dimensional plane
    - matplotlib
    - altair
    - plotly 
- Combining models
- metrics of success 
- Design the problem based on what data do we have as it comes in rather then holding out Petal.Width and using Petal.Length, Sepal.Width, and Sepal.Length
- Have a plethora of examples 
- Model explainers
- Write a medium article about this?

### Packages Used
